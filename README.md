## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn

## Data Exploration
- Importing the "Zen of Python," a collection of guiding principles for writing clear and readable Python code:
  ```python
  import this
  ```
- Data exploration techniques using Pandas, including:
  - Loading financial data
  - Statistical analysis
  - Data distribution
  - Segmentation
  - Correlation analysis

## Statistical Analysis
- Key functions used in the analysis:
  - `pct_change()`: Calculate the percentage change between the current and a prior element.
  - `rolling()`: Perform rolling window calculations.
  - `shift()`: Shift the index by a specified number of periods.
  - `cumsum()`: Compute the cumulative sum of a DataFrame or Series.

### Data Sources
- Financial data from S&P 500 companies:
  ```python
  url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies'
  ```
- Real estate data for analysis:
  ```python
  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsrpy/NYC-Property-Regression/master/real_estate_data.csv?_sm_au_=iVVwNVprVRrvTLDn"
  ```

### Example Tickers
- Tesla:
  ```python
  tickers = ["TSLA"]
  ```
- Microsoft:
  ```python
  tickers = ["MSFT"]
  ```

## How to Use the Notebook
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute each cell to explore and analyze the financial data.
